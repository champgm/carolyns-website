    bioText: "Carolyn Freeman is a native of nearby Mobile, Alabama and moved to New Orleans in 1996 to attend Loyola University of New Orleans. She graduated with a B.A. in Psychology, later furthering her education to earn a M.A. in Sociology from the University of New Orleans. Upon graduation, Carolyn began working with non-profit organizations in partnership with local public schools. A 12-year career working with non-profit organizations provided Carolyn with the opportunity to contribute to the local educational reform, while supporting the arts and revitalization of the great city of New Orleans. In July of 2013, Carolyn decided to follow her passion for New Orleans architecture, pursuing a new career path as a Realtor. Carolyn specializes in historic homes and investment properties so making a career with Dorian Bennett Sotheby's International Realty was a perfect fit. She provides her clients with a deep knowledge and passion for the unique artistry present in neighborhoods throughout the city and the surrounding metropolitan area. Her love for the diversity of southern architecture has been passed down to her from her grandparents. Active in Mobile's historic preservation efforts, Carolyn's grandparents also operated a tour guide service that allowed visitors to explore the rich architectural elements of the city's homes and plantations. As a child, Carolyn also accompanied them on many visits to New Orleans to view the grand homes in the Garden District and French Quarter. In addition, Carolyn's family has renovated many historic, southern properties, including a family home passed down through seven generations. Carolyn purchased her first home in the Mid-City neighborhood of New Orleans in 2000, gaining hands on experience renovating the 100+ year-old home. Carolyn is active in many local organizations. Her civic contributions include work with the United Way, New Orleans Kids Partnership, United Nonprofits of New Orleans, and the Jefferson Parish Alliance of Concerned Citizens. She is also a member of the New Orleans Metropolitan Association of RealtorsÂ®."
